# End of lesson discussion

Now is a good time to decompress with a class-wide open discussion. This is not graded. 

**Questions to guide the discussion:**

1. Were any of your preconceptions about what design is challenged or confirmed? If so, what were they?
2. Do you normally consume any design news or entertainment/infotainment?
