# Design Case Study

In this case study, we'll explore how the people worked together to design massive patches of garbage now floating in the Pacific Ocean: [Garbage Patch Design](http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/how-big-great-pacific-garbage-patch-science-vs-myth.html)

This is a great example of large scale outcomes from designers not using systems thinking when creating products. 

## How did it happen?

Chain of events, by stakeholder.

Material producers: **Material design**

- Plastic becomes easy to produce, making glass unappealing

Business and economics: **Product Design**

- Availability of cheap plastic materials and mass production technology.
- Business goals and values do not align with minimizing impact to existing ecological system

Public consensus:** marketing design**

- Ad campaigns infiltrate popular culture
- Wastefulness is normalized

Waste management processes: **Service Design**

- Wastefulness is good for business
- No real long-term ecological considerations for disposal

Government: **Policy Design**

- Corporate lobbying prevents ecological policies from hindering sales of products
- Issue not prioritized by society
- Recycling initiatives are not timely and universally ineffective

Ecological systems:

- Animals eat the waste allowing plastic waste to both enter the food chain 
- Wildlife are harmed by ingesting or becoming trapped by waste
- Climate systems cause garbage to wash onto coastlines and to form giant masses in the Pacific Ocean.
