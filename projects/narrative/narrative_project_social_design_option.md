## Brief

For this project, you will create a hypertext fiction with an open-source application called Twine focused on building a better future world, set in the year 2047. A hypertext fiction is a fictional story that is read by progressing through a series of story nodes containing hypertext links, with each link leading to another node in the story. You will follow a design process that will help you generate ideas, create characters and plot, incorporate feedback, and iterate towards a final work.
