# Deliver: Hypertext Story
In this phase, you will use a tool called Twine to create an interactive narrative from your latest narrative draft. Twine allows you to create linked decision nodes, similar to a choose your own adventure book where you can follow different story paths.

Twine is available as a downloadable app for Linux, OSX, and Windows, or as an online editor located at [twinery.org/2](https://twinery.org/2/). You can use either to complete this project, but you will need to submit the compiled HTML story file.


## Building with Twine

1. Use Twinery.org to create a hypertext narrative from the narrative that you wrote in the development phase of the project.
2. Follow the Twine Tutorial to learn how to create either a linear or non-linear narrative. Your narrative should take a viewer no longer than 10 minutes to get through the critical pathway.
3. You can add as many supporting events or nodes as you want. If you are unsure of what type of story to produce, start with a linear narrative model. Refer back to the topic on story structure for more information.
