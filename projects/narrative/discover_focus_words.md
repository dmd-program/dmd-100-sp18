# Discover: Word-pairs

## Instructions
1. In your journal, write three objects from your home. If you cannot think of any, choose three objects from a random object generator. Here is [one](http://roger.redevised.com/). (2 mins)
2. Free association writing. (10 mins)
  - On a journal page, write as many adjectives about this object as you can.
  - Circle three adjectives.
3. Choose **one** focus word from the list below. Write the adjectives circled from the previous step in front of your chosen focus word, creating three word-pairs (I.E. - if you choose education, you would combine your adjectives with only education):
  - education
  - economy
  - health
  - wellness
  - transportation
  - technology
  - government
  - freedom
  - justice
  - democracy
  - business
  - trade
  - environment
  - food
  - agriculture
  - ecosystem
  - energy
  - labor
4. Now that you have created three word-pairs, write each one onto a separate journal page.
  - Imagine it is the year 2047 and an ideal or positive situation has occurred, inspired by the word-pair. Think of one-sentence descriptions to explain the scenario. Try to have an inspiration source for your ideas, though you do not need to mention it. Inspiration can come from film, books, news, personal experiences, etc. For example, a news article for [drone pizza delivery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/08/25/hungry-your-pizza-drone-will-be-there-in-30-minutes/) might inspire an idea for a fleet of autonomous drones continually powered by the sun that search and report animal poachers to the authorities. Write as many responses per word-pairs as you can. Limit yourself to 30 minutes.
