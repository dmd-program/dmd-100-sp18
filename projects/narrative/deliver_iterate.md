# Deliver: Hypertext Story Draft 2

Iterative improvement is the key to good design. Now that you have peer feedback, tweak, change, and improve your work. Re-read your story and identify where you might be able to further develop characters, increase tension and drama, introduce dialogue, alter story pacing, smooth out awkward transitions, etc.

In this draft, consider the role of style in your narrative. 

## Instructions

1. Explore examples of narrative style. If you can identify some emerging in your story: 
1. Review your feedback for the hypertext narrative.
   1. If you are unsure about how feedback works, please see these [guidelines](/toolkit/feedback-and-critique.md).
2. Analyze, interpret, and apply relevant feedback to improve the project.
3. Record the changes that you made to the hypertext narrative.
4. Publish the HTML file.

## Post work to the Studio

1. Write a short description about the changes and improvements that were made
2. Upload the exported Twine HTML file \(or ZIP file if you have multiple assets\).
