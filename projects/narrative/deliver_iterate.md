# Deliver: Iterate

Iterative improvement is the key to good design. Now that you have peer feedback, tweak, change, and improve your work. Re-read your story and identify where you might be able to further develop characters, increase tension and drama, introduce dialogue, alter story pacing, smooth out awkward transitions, etc. 

## Instructions

1. Review your feedback for the hypertext narrative.
   1. If you are unsure about how feedback works, please see these [guidelines](/toolkit/feedback-and-critique.md).
2. Analyze, interpret, and apply relevant feedback to improve the project.
3. Record the changes that you made to the hypertext narrative.
4. Publish the HTML file.

## Post work to the Studio

1. Write a short description about the changes and improvements that were made
2. Upload the exported Twine HTML file \(or ZIP file if you have multiple assets\).
