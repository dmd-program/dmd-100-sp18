# Define: Synopsis

In this activity, you will create a short synopsis sentence to guide the story narrative.

## Instructions

1. Read through the responses from the word-pair activity and choose the one that sounds the most interesting to you.
2. Write the response as a short sentence that explains the way it _was_ in **\(this year\)**, and the way it _is_ 30 years later in 20xx. **"In the year 2017 \(the way it was\), but now in 2047 \(how it's better world\)."** An example sentence would be: _"In 2017, the Earth's wildlife was experiencing a high rate of extinction, but now in 2047 almost all of the world's endangered wildlife species are back to healthy populations."_
