# Develop: Test and Iterate

Now that your prototype is done, it is time to participate in feedback. You will be assigned a few prototypes to review. Your prototype will also be reviewed by your classmates. This is an opportunity to practice receiving and interpreting feedback. A critique of your work might be stressful at first, but it is one of the most common, and useful processes in design.

## Instructions

1. **Provide feedback** to your assigned prototypes based on the following criteria:
   1. Are you able to clearly understand the relationship between the app and the ritual? Why or why not?
   2. Does the app seem integral to the ritual? Why?
2. **Read the feedback you have been given.** To plan a course of action, you can categorize what was said in four categories: compliment, advice, criticism, and suggestion. Based on which category the feedback lands, you can analyze how to make decisions to improve your work.

## Post work to the Studio

1. Submit your feedback as a comment to your group members' assignments on their Studio Prototype submission.
