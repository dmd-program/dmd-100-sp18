# Develop: Prototype

Now that you have a storyboard, you will prototype a mobile application interface using a process known as paper prototyping. Paper prototyping is a quick way to simulate a product before too many resources are used to design and engineer the final product. It works as a kind of model that others can react to, giving designers and insight as to whether they are going in the right direction. The purpose of this prototype is to quickly communicate to your peers how you intend to use a mobile device application to faciliate a ritual.

## Tools and Materials

1. Pen or Marker
2. Assorted paper
3. Scissors
4. Ruler
5. Cellphone Camera
6. InVision App \(Free account\)
7. InVision Mobile App \(free download\)

## Prototyping Instructions

1. Identify parts of the storyboard that can translate into mobile application functions. For instance, if the ritual has a time component, then you can build in an timed audio cue into the prototype \(represented visually\).
2. Create the paper interface components
   1. In the center of the graph paper, draw a rectangle approximately 3.5 inches tall by 2 inches wide. This will define the border of the paper prototype screen.
   2. On another sheet, draw interface elements including buttons, images, icons, and text.
   3. Cut out reusable interface elements so they can be rearranged for each application screen
   4. Arrange the components for each screen and take a picture with your phone's camera
3. Upload prototype interfaces to InvisionApp
   1. Move the image files from your phone or camera to your computer.
   2. Crop each image to the screen border using the cropping methods suggested in the technical resources
   3. Sign into InvisionApp and create a new project. Choose the phone portrait template.
   4. Upload your cropped images to InvisionApp
   5. Build interactivity using InvisionApp's built-in hotspot and linking tools
   6. Test that all the desired interactivity is functioning
4. Download a ZIP file of the project from the InvisionApp's project navigation bar
5. Click the share button and choose share public link at the bottom to copy the public share link.

## Design Document

* Start your document with the following: "**This is a prototype for an app that...**" To complete the sentence, use your brainstorming ideas and storyboard.
* Describe the ritual in detail and how the prototype works.
* Write clearly, and check for grammar and spelling errors

## Steps to completion

1. Create the prototype using the prototyping instructions
2. Download a ZIP archive of your prototype from InvisionApp and upload to the Studio
3. Submit a Public Share Link to your submission in the Studio
4. Write a design document according to the document requirements and upload to the Studio
