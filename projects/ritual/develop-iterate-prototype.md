# Develop: Iterate prototype

This is the first round of iterative improvement. Read your feedback and consider how to implement the recommendations from course instructors and your peers.

## Instructions:

1. Make changes based on the peer and instructor feedback and **download** the prototype file from InVision. You will receive feedback, do not submit without iterating upon your work. 
2. Write a description of the changes made to the prototype in a `.doc` file.

## Post work to the Studio

Use the exact indicated file format. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements.

1. Upload a `prototype-USERID.zip` file of the prototype.
2. Upload a `changelog.doc` with all changes that were made.
