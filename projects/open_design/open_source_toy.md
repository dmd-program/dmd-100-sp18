# Open Toy Kit Project: Introduction

In this project, you will design a kit of parts that can be used to build a toy, model, or other object. This object will be a collection or kit of parts that can be reconfigured to create variations. There are two ways to approach this project. You can decide to create your own parts, custom from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, etc. Or, you could develop creative ways of using commonly found objects like rubber bands, toothpicks, paper clips, etc. The goal of this project is to develop a kit using commonly available resources. According to the most [recent and comprehensive data](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier and cheaper it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the more accessible your project will be.

## Constraints

1. You must not spend more than $10.00 USD to assemble the kit.
2. Your users must be able to assemble their kits without special skills or tools.
   1. Allowed tools: Scissors, exacto knife
   2. Allowed marking implements: Pen, pencil, marker

## Audience

1. Conduct desktop and field research of toy kits and models. Investigate websites that sell toys and visit physical toy and hobby stores. See if you can understand the ways in which 
2. Choose an age that you would like to focus on. The end user does not have to be a child.
3. What purpose does the kit serve?
4. Geographical location?
5. Who is building vs using?

## Category

What kind of kit are you building?

**Category ideas:**

* Human or animal figures
* Architectural models
* Machines
* Structures and shapes
* Puzzle or game
* Integrated electronics

## Part types

* Symbols
* Shapes
* Fasteners
* Connectors
* Support structures

### Attributes

* Name
* Description
* Is this modular or a unique \(one-off\) component?
* Quantity
* Cost breakdown

## Variations

How many variations that can be constructed by reconfiguring the same parts?

## Kit prototype

How will you help users gain mastery of using the kit?

1. **Create instructions for your users to follow.** Instructions can include any one of or combination of photos or drawings, diagrams, audio, pre-recorded video, and/or step-based text instructions. Select your media based on the user's age.
2. Instructions should include any process or technique required to prepare parts and how to combine parts together. 

## Testing, feedback, and iteration

Ideally, you will want to get feedback from a user representative of your audience both in terms of who will be constructing with the kit and who will be the end user. For instance, a parent might be the one to put the kit together if the toy is intended for a small child. Alternatively, a child might be assembling the kit for themselves or as a gift for another.

### **Plan a user test session**

Carefully observe someone attempting to use the kit. Take notes of what you notice. You may need to give some verbal suggestions if your users get stuck, but try to say as little as possible. After the user has assembled the kit per the instructions, ask them some followup questions. Take pictures of your test users during this process.

**Example followup questions include:**

1. What did you like about using the kit?
2. What didn't you like? Why is that?
3. Is there anything that can be improved on?
4. Do you want more or less control over the final result?

## Kit

### Photo Documentation should include:

1. Single kit of parts image: knolling style
2. Photos of various assemblies demonstrating the modular or reconfigurable characteristics of the kit



## Requirements:

1. Parts should be simple \( avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing.\)

2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same\)

There are many examples of modular toys and kits in stores and on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you.

**Develop phase questions:**

1. Template for users to build their own modular toys?
2. What kind of toys will be made?
3. What raw building materials are used, and for what parts?
4. What tools and fasteners will be needed?
5. Will there be standard or modular parts?
6. What making processes will the users undergo?
7. What are the instructions?

**Deliver phase notes:**

1. Prototype
2. Test run/feedback/refine

**Documentation:**

The kit should be documented in a photography style known as _**knolling**_: [Examples](http://theultralinx.com/2013/09/50-amazing-examples-knolling-photography/)
