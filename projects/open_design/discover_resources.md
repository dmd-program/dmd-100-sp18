# Discover: Resources

In this activity, you will be gathering information about the raw materials available to complete the project. Remember, you have a budget between $0 and $10. Ideally, someone with no financial resources should be able to reproduce your design. Please do not use combustable or explosive materials like matches, or materials that would most likely injure someone such as shards of glass or harmful chemicals. Safety first.

## Instructions

1. **Take Stock:** Photograph materials and objects from around your household or that you discard, or commonly acquire for free with other things that you buy. Of these materials, what might be useful?
2. **Local materials:** Go to a supermarket, hardware, craft supply store, or any other store that may have raw materials you can use. Photograph and document potential materials, objects, fasteners. Pay attention to the inexpensive or bulk products.

## Post work to the Studio

1. Upload photographs of materials.
