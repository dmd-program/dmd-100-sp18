# Define: Success

Start thinking about what would need to occur in order for the project to succeed. For example, if your HMW question is focused on making sure that your toy has parts that are easy to customize, then highlighting ease of customization as a criterion would be helpful.

## Instructions
1. Return to your How Might We question. Think about a set of metrics or criteria by which you can judge success?
2. What are other considerations for success? Look at this from the perspective of the people you are designing for.
