# Open Design Project

## Brief

In this project, you will follow the Double Diamond design process to: \(1\) design a kit of parts that can be used to build a toy, model, or other object; \(2\) write comprehensive instructions for how to make the parts and assemble the kit; and \(3\) create photo documentation of your work.

This object will be a collection or kit of parts that can be reconfigured to create variations. This is serious \(though playful\) product design. You can create your own custom parts from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, and others, or found objects like rubber bands, toothpicks, paper clips, etc. A **part** is a discrete element and is different from an ingredient in that it maintains its structural integrity when it's separated, whereas an ingredient gets combined and can not be separated again without a complex separation process. Ingredients should not form the basis of the toy.

The primary goal of this project is to apply open design concepts to creating object using commonly available resources, and empower others to do the same. Secondary goals are to become familiar with product and market research, gain experience with user testing and feedback, practice presenting design process, produce knowledge design, and explore the IKEA effect for products.

**Note:** Remember, none of this is fiction. You are creating a real instruction set with everything needed for the end user to do this on their own. If you are incorporating templates, include them in the instructions for your users.

### Background

According to the most [recent and comprehensive data](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier and cheaper it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the more accessible your project will be.

Originally conceived by the Institute Without Boundaries, the [Open Structures project](http://beta.openstructures.net/pages/9) has defined design guidelines to aid the users of the design framework: (1) Design for disassembly, (2) Design with recyclable materials, (3) Design from the OS grid. They are concerned that the objects can be taken apart once built, that they don't harm the environment if discarded, and that anything designed with the system will be interoperable.

## Requirements:

1. Parts should be simple \(avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing\).
2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same\).
3. Materials should not cost more than $10.
4. You should be able to create three distinctly different objects with the same kit, tools, and assembly processes.
5. You must design everything, and everything needed for another person to follow your instructions must be included in the PDF. This includes templates.

There are many examples of modular toys and kits in stores and on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you.
