# Design for Adaptation: Introduction

In this project, you will **blank** that can be easily used and adapted by others.

In this collaborative design project, you will create a (drawing, object) for the purpose of subjecting it to a process of adaptation.

Project will result in a digital artifact.

Produce a set of instructions

Produce a new life form

**Generative infrastructure**

The goal of this project is for you to create the infrastructure upon which others can build from.

**Open source Toy**

**Idea 1**

Templates for toys

1. Invent a new kind of template for users to build their own modular toys
2. What kind of toys will be made?
3. What raw building materials are used, and for what parts?
4. What tools and fasteners will be needed?
5. Will there be standard or modular parts?
4. What making processes will the users undergo?
3. What are the instructions? 
4. Test run
5. Prototype

**Idea 2**

Disaster-resistant Objects

Evolve a product or service according to new environmental stimuli

1. Existing product
  1. Choose a common household object. Explain the function of this object in the home. Who interacts with it, what is it for, who made it, how long will it last?
2. Existing environment
  1. Describe the context in which it lives
3. Environmental threat
  1. Apply a natural phenomenon.
4. Develop a resistance to this threat
  1. Describe how the object could adapt to it's environment
  2. What changes would need to be made, physically, socially, etc.
5. Product rendering
  1. Draw the object before. Draw the object after.
