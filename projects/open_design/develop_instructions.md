# Develop: Instructions

Now you will make a set of instructions to teach another person to create and assemble the toy(s) you have designed.

**Note:** Remember, none of this is fiction. You are creating a real instruction manual with everything needed for the end user to do this on their own. If you are incorporating templates, they will be printing those templates out from your instructions.

## Document requirements

1. Title of your toy design
2. By line with your name
3. Brief description of the toy
4. List any safety hazards and/or if adult supervision is required.
5. Required materials
  1. Include a cost breakdown
6. Required tools
7. Estimated time to complete the assembly
8. Parts manifest
  1. List and name each distinct part that will be constructed or used and how many will be needed.
9. Step by step instructions for one object variant.

## Instructions

1. If you do you not have skills to use professional layout software like Adobe Illustrator or InDesign, use word processing or presentation software to create the instructions.
    - Include photos, drawings, figures, diagrams, templates, and any other visual information that may aid the understanding of the instructions. 
2. Export the instructions in `.pdf` format.

## Post work to the Studio

1. Upload the instructions PDF document.
