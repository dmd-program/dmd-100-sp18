# Brainstorm

Now that you have a direction, it's time to brainstorm some ideas. Generating ideas by yourself \(AKA â€“ in a vacuum\) can be fairly difficult if you are new to this process. Even experienced designers benefit from working in groups because typically the array of ideas generated in a discussion is far larger than when working alone. For this step, you will partner up with small groups to brainstorm ideas for each person's project.

Groups should meet via video call. Available tools include Skype, Bluejeans, gChat, AppleFacetime, . If the video call fails do to Internet connectivity issues, follow the directions, but using a chat tool of your choice.

## Materials and tools

* Pen/Marker
* Poster-board \(An area of open wall can also work\)
* Post-it notes
* Index card or similarly sized sticky paper
* Computer with Webcam and steady Internet Connection

## **Roles and Rules**

### Discussion Rounds

1. Introduce yourselves if you don't already all know each other.
2. There will be one brainstorming round for each person in the group.
3. Each round will focus on a different person's HMW question.
4. Designated recorder. For each round, the person currently in focus for the discussion will be the designated recorder of the discussion, and is responsible for uploading the recorded accounts of the conversation.
5. Spend about 10-15 minutes minutes per round. The designated recorder is responsible for keeping time.

### Brainstorming

1. **Quantity over quality.** The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible.
2. **Defer judgement.** Silly and outlandish ideas are just as useful as, and sometimes more exciting than, sensible ideas.
3. **Be positive.** When building upon others ideas, use "yes, and also" instead of "but" or "well." These small language nuances change the tone of the discussion to feel more supportive and inclusive.
4. **Focus.** It's easy to derail a brainstorming session. If it happens, refocus on the task at hand.
5. **Simplify.** If an idea takes two sentences to describe, try simplifying it to the core idea using as few words as possible.

## Steps to completion

1. Ensure that you have read the Roles and Rules.
2. Before the group video call, write your HMW question on a piece of sticky paper or index card and affix it to the poster board.
3. Decide on the order you will all go. 
4. Designated recorder: Set a timer for 15 minutes. 
5. The designated recorder will read the HMW question to the group.
6. The group will spend up to 15 minutes generating ideas for the HMW question.
   1. The designated recorder will write down the ideas onto sticky notes and put them on the poster-board.
   2. After 15 minutes, briefly discuss which ideas you like.
7. When all group members have taken their turn, you are finished the brainstorming session.
8. Take a picture of your poster-board of ideas and upload to the Studio. Follow documentation guidelines.
9. Fill out the de-brief report.
