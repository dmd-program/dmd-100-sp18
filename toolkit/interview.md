# Interview

## Steps to completion
1. Prepare for the interview with a set of questions. Start by asking broad questions about the interviewee's values and habits before asking more specific questions related to your research.
2. Either record in writing or obtain permission to record audio of the interview session. Never record someone without their knowledge or permission.
  - If writing down responses, write what the person says exactly, do not interpret meaning. If you are relying on a translator, be sure to ask for the exact wording of the responses.
  - If recording audio be sure to listen after the session is over and write the responses on paper.
3. If interviewing in person, be sure to capture body language and the context of the responses.

## Deliverables
1. Write your recording in the observations input box on the assignment submission.
