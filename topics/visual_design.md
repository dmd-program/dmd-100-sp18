## Principles of Design

### Balance

When design elements are distributed in such a way that they draw the viewers attention to the entire composition, it can be said to have good balance. There tends to be a single focus point in work that is not balanced properly, where the viewer is not compelled to look at the entire composition.

Balance can be achieved through both formal and informal composition techniques. Formal composition relies on mathematical patterns that produce symmetrical duplicates. Informal compositions tend to be asymmetrical, and rely on other principles such as dominance and scale to achieve balance.

### Dominance, emphasis, and focal point

This key principle is responsible for drawing a viewer's attention. An image can have more than one focal point, and a master painter could use the shifting of focus as a means to tell a story.

### Movement

### Repetition, Rhythm, Pattern

### Proportion and scale

### Variety and variation

### Unity/Harmony

## Elements of Visual Design

### Line

A line is a two dimensional element, often referred to as a mark.

* Implied: Sometimes the way two solid areas of color collide to form an implied line.
* Outlines: edge that defines the shape and space of a subject.
* Attributes of a line: Integrity \(solid or broken\), thickness, direction, complexity \(straightness\).

### Shape

* Geometric
* Organic

### Form

### Space

### Color

* Hue
  * Determined by the part\(s\) of the visible light spectrum
* Saturation/Intensity
  * Purity of a color
  * Brightness or dullness of a color
* Value
  * Lightness or darkness of a color

### Contrast

Two elements placed in close proximity with opposing qualities creates contrast. Contrast is often used to direct focus

### Texture

* Real
* Implied

## Formal analysis

When analyzing and critiquing visual work, there are three things to take into account that will make your feedback understandable by others:

1. Name the formal element
2. Describe what it is doing
3. Discuss the effect it has with respect to the entire work.

Perception

## Gestalt
