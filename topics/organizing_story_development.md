# Story development

Story development is a generative process where ideas, themes, and unique characteristics tend to surface through iteration and reflection. It is also a technical process, where common elements are added subtracted, combined, and transformed to convey meaning, encourage insights, and intensify excitement.

### Show, don't tell.

When drafting a story, it is often best to convey information and ideas indirectly. For instance, you could write, "Xavier was a very nice person." Alternatively, you could write, "Xavier spent his weekends volunteering at a local shelter and worked part time as a nurse." Both methods communicate the kind of person Xavier is, but the latter is more engaging for the reader.

You can extrapolate this concept to practically everything you make. You want to let your viewers choose to connect the dots or leave some dots unconnected. If you don't give their brain any work to do, it can make for an extremely dull experience. Ask them to do too much work, and you risk giving them an experience that is confusing and frustrating.

### Story Elements

**!!!Idea, structure, story?**

#### Setting/environment

The setting is the environment that the story takes place. The setting helps establish the tone, story genre, and often foreshadows future events in the plot. In some video games, the environment is also a narrative device, providing context for the world the characters inhabit. 

#### Point of View (PoV)

Who is telling the story? Who are you experiencing the story through? Depending on the point of view, the author can create a sense of intimacy with the story, or a more objective and distant perspective.

1. First person: (I, we)
2. Second person: (you)
3. Third person:(he, she, they)

#### Character

1. Assign characterization types to characters
2. Develop character profiles
3. Identify tropes to apply to characters or change characters to avoid unwanted tropes

#### Plot

1. Write critical beats (decision points)
  - Supports critical story path
  - Include elements:
    - Exposition
    - Conflict
    - Resolution 
3. Write optional beats.
  -  These become possible branches in your narrative.


#### Structure

1. Choose or design a structural model
  - Should support critical story path and desired supplemental story interaction
  - If developing an interactive story, the structure might be on a dynamic scale between linear and non-linear. In games, cut scenes tend to be linear while gameplay and interaction tends to be non-linear.

## Narrative media

1. Types
  - **Single source media**
    - There are too many types of media to list here, but any method of communicating to a person is a type of media. For the purposes of this topic, an interactive digital hypertext narrative (a website with links) will be the type of media used to provide an experience for viewers of your story.
  - **Trans-media:** Trans-media refers to the idea that a narrative is communicated and experienced across multiple forms of media. A good example of a trans-media narrative project is documented in the film, [The Institute (2013)](http://www.theinstitutemovie.com). In the film, fictional and non-fiction stories unfold through a wide array of media including paper fliers, physical installations and puzzles, radio programs, organized events, video recordings, phone calls, and others.
