# Discover: Journey Map

A journey map is great way to visualize an entire process of an interaction. By visualizing each step, you will better understand the nuances of an experience.

**Example steps for a journey map: Mowing the lawn**

1. I realized the grass was too long.
2. I decided to mow the lawn with my lawnmower.
3. I walked to the garage and waited for the automatic door to lift.
4. There were many objects in the way that I had to move.
5. I pulled the lawnmower out of the garage.
6. I checked to see that it had gasoline - it was low.
7. I poured gasoline into the lawnmower
8. I started to mow the grass, and made a lot of noise
9. I emptied the grass clippings many times during the process
10. I stopped to get a drink of water halfway through, because I was dehydrated.
11. I thought about how I disliked mowing the lawn because the process is time consuming, dirty, and noisy
12. I eventually finished and put the lawnmower back into the garage, and moved the objects back as they were
13. I closed the garage door

3. Write down the name of any other key moments on separate Post-it notes. Try to identify as many as you can. Consider what the most critical aspects of what the experience might be. 
4. Place the Post-it notes in order as you would likely experience them.
