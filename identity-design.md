# Identity design

A person spends a great deal of time doing **impression management**, that is, managing the impression one makes on another. This idea that we want to control how people view us means that we are consciously or unconsciously aligning our own behaviors to conform to a set of norms or ideals—a kind of self design. This is done in a variety of ways, including the clothes you wear, the house you live in, the car you drive, and many other material aspects of living. These consumer purchases play a role in helping people express certain aspects of their personality and social status. And it is this idea that personality can be expressed through products that interests the advertisement and marketing industry. Psychologists say there are six major traits that differentiate the personality of human minds.

> A century of psychology has identified six major dimensions of variation that predict human behavior and that are salient to us. These are the key individual differences that distinguish human minds. These are mental traits that can be measured with good reliability and validity, that are genetically heritable, and stable across the life span, that predict behavior across diverse settings and domains, \(school, work, leisure, consumption, and family life\), and that seem to be universal across cultures and even across many animal species. \[1\]

Identified with the acronym, **GOCASE**, each letter represents a different trait. **G** represents general intelligence, **O** represents openness to experience, **C** is for conscientiousness and self-control,  **A** is for agreeableness and kindness, **S** is for stability in emotion, and **E** is for extraversion. Conceivably, if you have an ability to understand a person based on those traits you will have a good idea about how they will behave in different circumstances.

Marketers have concerned themselves with selling products to people by appealing to these personality traits. Consumers can express personality traits through their material possessions. **Propaganda** is used to sell products just as it is to galvanize mass consensus around a political viewpoint. After World War II, the term took on a more sinister meaning due to the Nazi's considerable and effective use of design and media for propagandistic ends. Edward Bernays is considered the father of public relations \(a term synonymous with advertising and propaganda\) authored a book in 1928 aptly named, [_Propaganda_](http://www.historyisaweapon.org/defcon1/bernprop.html). Bernay's, Sigmund Freud's nephew, applied Freudian ideas of unconscious desire for selling  products and manipulation of mass opinion, inventing techniques that are in standard use today by politicians and corporations.

> The propagandist must treat personality as he would treat any other objective fact within his province.

All of this contributes to the way humans made decisions.

## What is identity?

Identity is who we are, who we think we are, and what others see us as. Identity can scale from a single person to an entire nation. Identification is an essential process for human decision making. Differentiating between safe or dangerous is one of the first things humans do unconsciously, and this process is typically based on patterns of the familiar. This is why if you are used to spending time only with the people that are visually similar to you

Ontology: The study of the nature of being.

## Brand identity

Branding is the narrative that presents the story of a person, company, product, service, or organization to others. Brands are supposed to help people make choices, and reassure them that they made the correct one at a time where products are saturated with competition. The "Tyranny of Choice" is when the overabundance of options paralyzes a person's ability to choose. A good example of this can be experienced in the American supermarket. For this example, let's consider which toothbrush to buy, for me a stressful task that never feels gratifying. Some questions I ponder are; which toothbrush has the most effective bristle pattern? Which bristle hardness is the right hardness? Which will cause the least harm to the environment? Which will last the longest before needing to buy another one? Does the value-pack of 4 toothbrushes make financial sense? Are their reviews that can help me decide? Maybe I should try that sonic thing that shoots sound-waves at my teeth. Why does the eco-friendly bamboo toothbrush cost twice as much and though it looks like it will do half as good a job at cleaning? I typically spend 20 minutes in the isle trying to figure out which option is best option before I give up and purchase the same kind of toothbrush I have been using for the last decade.

Good branding will communicate the product's attributes and benefits to a person who has corresponding values to hep them choose that product, and feel that they've made the right choice. Buyer's remorse is when someone has regret after buying something, often because they prioritized incorrectly or didn't spend enough time thinking about their choice.

In corporate branding, the market drives brand identity design for the purpose of attracting customers, clients, suppliers, investors, and other stakeholders. Branding can help a company to promote a kind of historical heritage, disruptive newness, or another set of values in order to appeal to a target market. Logos, word-marks, letterhead, packaging, architecture, employee culture, and product aesthetics, all contribute to the brand identity.
