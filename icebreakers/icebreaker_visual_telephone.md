Step 1  
  - Everyone in the group should write one sentence (silly or serious) on the top of your piece of paper
  - Fold over the top of the paper to hide the sentence
  - Pass your paper to the person on your right

Step 2  
  - Unfold the paper you just received to reveal the sentence
  - Draw a picture of what you see
  - Fold your paper to hide the sentence at the top, then fold it again to hide the picture below it
  - Pass the piece of paper to the right

Step 3  
  - Unfold the paper you just received to reveal only the picture (not the sentence)
  - Write a new sentence below the picture, describing what you see
  - Fold the paper three times to hide the first sentence, then the picture, then the last sentence
  - Pass it to the right

Step 4  
  - Unfold the paper you just received to reveal only the last sentence · Draw a picture based on what you see.
  - Fold the paper four times
  - Pass it to the right

***Repeat until your original paper returns to you. Unfold it and see how much the story has changed!***
